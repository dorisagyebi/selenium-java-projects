## Overview
This project contains various Selenium WebDriver scripts written in Java for automating tasks like handling alerts, login, sign-up, and demonstrating explicit and implicit waits. It utilizes different browsers like Chrome and Firefox to interact with web elements, leveraging CSS Selectors, XPath, and waits to control web page behavior.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- Selenium WebDriver library included in the project.
- Browser drivers (ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver) set up and added to the system path.
- Locators class containing necessary URLs, usernames, and other data.K

## Scripts Overview
1. **Alerts.java**: Automates the handling of different types of alerts (simple, confirmation, and prompt).
2. **EspLogin.java**: Automates the login process and verifies the presence of a welcome message.
3. **EspSignUp.java**: Automates the sign-up process by filling in user details and interacting with dropdowns.
4. **ExplicitWait.java**: Demonstrates the use of explicit waits to wait for an element before performing an action.
5. **Implicit_Wait.java**: Demonstrates the use of implicit waits to delay the execution until an element is found.


## Dependencies
- Selenium WebDriver
